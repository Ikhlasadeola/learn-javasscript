// Steps to implement calculator functionality:

// 1. Select the display and all calculator buttons from the DOM.

// 2. Add event listeners to the buttons to handle clicks.

// 3. When a number or operator button is clicked, update the display accordingly.

// 4. When the '=' button is clicked, evaluate the expression in the display and show the result.

// 5. When the 'C' (clear) button is clicked, reset the display to empty.

// 6. Handle edge cases (e.g., multiple operators, invalid input, division by zero).

// 7. Optionally, add keyboard support for calculator operations.
